# urdf-loaders

URDF loading code in both [C# for Unity](./unity/Assets/lib/) and [Javascript for THREE.js](./javascript/), as well as example [JPL ATHLETE](https://www-robotics.jpl.nasa.gov/systems/system.cfm?System=11) URDF files

### Gotchas

The loaders support the necessary subset of the [URDF spec](http://wiki.ros.org/urdf/XML) to load the ATHLETE URDF and meshes. Specifically the code only supports fixed and revoluate joints, as well as loading `.STL` mesh files at the moment.
